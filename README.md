# BeetleMeter
Raising a beetle is fun and wholesome but keeping an eye on the environment inside the little fella's enclosure can be stressful and complicated. For this reason, the BeetleMeter is a tiny battery-powered PCB that instantly notifies the beetle keeper if the temperature and humidity is too high, too low or just right, by the push of a button.
